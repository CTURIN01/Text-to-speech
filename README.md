# Python Text-to-Speech Application

This is a simple Text-to-Speech application built with Python using the `pyttsx3` library and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Convert text to speech
- Select from available system voices
- Adjust speaking rate
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pyttsx3 library
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `text_to_speech.py` file.

2. Install the required `pyttsx3` library using pip:

   ```
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   python text_to_speech.py
   ```

2. The application window will open with the following elements:
   - Text area: Enter the text you want to be spoken
   - Voice selection: Choose from available system voices
   - Rate adjustment: Slide to adjust the speaking rate
   - Speak button: Click to start the text-to-speech conversion

3. Enter your desired text, select a voice, adjust the rate if needed, and click the "Speak" button to hear the text spoken aloud.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with voice selection or text-to-speech functionality, ensure that you have system voices installed on your computer.
- On Windows, you can add or manage voices through the Speech settings in the Control Panel.
- On macOS, you can add or manage voices through the System Preferences > Accessibility > Speech settings.
